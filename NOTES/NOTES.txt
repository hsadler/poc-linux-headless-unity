TODOs:
    X poc running central game-client on server
    X confirm central game-client is running physics simulations
    X poc central game-client communication with Golang game server
    X local game receiving central game-client updates
    X run central client mode with env var
    X player client's ball's position should be updated by the server message
    - connect with multiple player clients to see bouncing ball
    - create player
    - stream player positions to central client
    - detect player->ball collisions on central client
    - (maybe) split golang gameserver image from central client image
